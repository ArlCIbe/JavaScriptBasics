# Objects

## Assignment: 

In this assignment, you will practice creating and creating and using objects in JavaScript to organize related pieces of data.

For this assignment, we'll look at ways we can organize info for each student. Instead of just taking roll or keeping them in an array based on their relative grade, let's look at how we can group their name (any string of characters), grade (any whole number from 0 - 100) and conduct (S, N, or U - short for Satisfactory, Needs Improvement, Unsatisfactory)

Example: 

    {
        Name: "Broly",
        Grade: 100,
        Conduct: 'S'
    }

### Instructions

#### Task 1: Setup Your Environment

##### 1.1 New File

- Open your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code) and clone down your assignment repo.

- Create a new JavaScript file named `object_lab.js`

    ```All following steps will be in this same file```

#### Task 2: Warm Up

- Create an array of 5 strings to hold student names.

- Output the names of the students in the array.

#### Task 3: Object Literals and Object Property Notations

To illustrate what we want our objects to look like, 

1. Create an object literal for a student, like `{ "name": "Kakarot", "grade": "9001", "conduct": "N"}`

2. Output the name of your student object in the console using dot notation

3. Output the grade of your student in the console using bracket notation

#### Task 4: new Objects from Constructor

- Create a constructor function that can be used to create multiple objects that have all of the same properties as your object literal.

- Create at least 5 more objects using the `new` keyword.

- Create an array to hold the objects you've created. 

- Output the names of the students using dot notation and the grades using bracket notation.
