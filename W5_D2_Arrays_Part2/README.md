# Arrays Part 2

## Assignment: 

In this assignment, you will practice creating and using arrays in JavaScript to store and use a group of similar types data.

For this assignment, you're a teacher maintaining a ranked list of students in a highly competitive class. Students may be added or dropped from the list depending on their performance. (Task 2). You'll also need to be able to read through all of the names to call roll (Task 3)

### Instructions

#### Task 1: Setup Your Environment

##### 1.1 New File

- Open your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code) and clone down your assignment repo.

- Create a new JavaScript file named `arrays_lab_2.js`

    ```All following steps will be in this same file```

##### 1.2 Create a Populated Array

- Declare and initialize a new array with at least five elements of any data type.

#### Task 2: Array Manipulation

##### 2.1 Remove a Specific Field - Student Drops Out of the Rankings

- Create a function that takes in 2 parameters. The first paremeter should be a number. The second parameter should be the populated array that you created.

- Within your function, use an array method to remove the element at the index of your parameter.

- Print the modified array to the console.

- Return the modified array at the end of the function.

##### 2.2 Add a New Field - A Student Enters the Rankings

- Create a function that takes in 2 parameters. The first paremeter should be a number. The second parameter should be the populated array that you created.

- Within your function, use an array method to remove the element at the index of your parameter.

- Use an array function to add a new element to your arry.

- Print the modified array to the console.

- Return the modified array at the end of the function.

##### 2.3 Insert at a Specific Index - A Student Earns a Specific Rank

- Create a function that takes in 2 parameters. The first paremeter should be a number. The second parameter should be the new value for an element in your array.

- Write an algorithm to place the 2nd parameter at the array's index of the first parameter.

- If the array has values at or after the index of the 1st parameter, they should be shifted down 1 index to make room for the new value.

- Remember control flow to ensure your function operates as you expect it to.

- Print the modified array to the console.

#### Task 3: Array Output

##### 3.1 Output All Values

- Write code to output all values from your populated array.

#### Task 4: Call your Functions

Congratulations! You've successfully completed the JavaScript Arrays Lab. Be sure to commit and push your changes back to Github to receive a grade.
