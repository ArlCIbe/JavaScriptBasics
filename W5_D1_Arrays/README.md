# Arrays

## Assignment: 


In this assignment, you will practice creating and using arrays in JavaScript to store and use a group of similar types of data.

For this assignment, you're a teacher maintaining a list of students. Your students like to change their nicknames so you may have to update the entries from time to time (Task 2). You'll also need to be able to read through all of the names to call roll (Task 3)

### Instructions

#### Task 1: Creating Arrays

##### 1.1 Create an Empty Array

- Open your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).

- Create a new JavaScript file named `arrays_lab.js`

- Declare an empty array with the name 'TEST'.

    ```All following steps will be in this same file```

##### 1.2 Create a Populated Array

- Declare and initialize a new array that contains at least 7 student names.

- Hint: Use a for loop to populate the array

#### Task 2: Array Manipulation - Check and Update Student Names

##### 2.1 Read a Specific Value

- Declare a variable and assign it the value of a specific element from your populated array from [step 1.2]().

- Print the value of the variable to the console.

- Print the value of the array element to the console.

##### 2.2 Update a Specific Field

- Write a function that takes in 2 parameters. The first paremeter should be a number. The second parameter should be the new value for an element in your array.

- Use the parameter as the index of your populated array (1.2).

- Update the value of the element at that index.

- Print the modified array to the console.

#### Task 3: Array Output - Roll Call

##### 3.1 Output First Value

- Write a function to output the first value from your populated array.

##### 3.2 Output Last Value

- Write a function to output the last value from your populated array.

##### 3.3 Output Specific Value

- Write a function that takes in a single number as a paremeter.

- Output the value from the student array where the array's index matches your parameter.

##### 3.4 Output All Values

- Write a function to output all values from your populated array.

#### Task 4: Call your Functions

- Remember, function code never executes if it doesn't get called.
